## Day 1


### Errors And Exeptions

errors are typically lower-level issues that may prevent your script from running, and they are not meant to be caught or handled. Exceptions, on the other hand, are higher-level issues that can be caught and dealt with in your code, allowing for more graceful error handling and recovery

### PDO 

PDO stands for "PHP Data Objects." It is a PHP extension that provides a uniform method of access to multiple databases. PDO offers a data-access abstraction layer, meaning that, regardless of which database you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), you can interact with it in a consistent way using PDO.

### The Defference Between PDO and MySQLI

PDO is a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases. It supports various database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and others.
MySQLi is specific to MySQL databases. It is designed to work with MySQL servers and does not provide a uniform interface for different database systems.

### MVC

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.

#### MVC: Model

Represents the data and business logic of the application.

#### MVC: View

Displays the data to the user and handles user input.

#### MVC: Controller

 Manages the communication between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the Model and View accordingly.
